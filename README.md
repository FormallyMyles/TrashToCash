# Mod Description

Sick of getting rid of perfectly good appliances with no benefit? TrashToCash is for you! Putting items outside will now give you 50% of the value back.

This means early game you'll have a chance to buy more appliances and late-game opens a new opportunity for bin loads of CASH!

Features:
- Items will display the value you will get when they are put out for the trash.
- After the round is over it will display how much TrashToCash made you (you'll be rich!)

Multiplayer Compatibility: This mod is only required on the host, when using the mod when you're not the host it will display the prices but you won't receive money (so convince your friends to get the mod so you can make more money!!).

Mod Compatibility: This mod should work with most mods, it has been tested with several of the most popular mods. If you have issues please comment so we can inform others / look into resolving it.

Requirements: Harmony/HarmonyX is required for this mod to work, this is because it patches in-game to add the functionality.

# Compiling the Mod

The mod is compiled with Visual Studio 2022, you will need to update the PlateUpFolder path in TrashToCash.csproj.
